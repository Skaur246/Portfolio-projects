# Machine Learning Capstone (Orange)

## Overview
This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to multiple real-world scenarios using Orange. I built and evaluated regression and classification models, compared their performance using appropriate metrics, and selected the best model for each scenario based on accuracy, error, and interpretability.

The project includes human development index (HDI) prediction, employee attrition analysis, and advertising sales prediction.
