# Statistics for Data Science (Excel)

## Overview
This project focuses on applying statistical concepts used in data science and machine learning. Using Excel, I analyzed datasets to compute descriptive statistics, probability measures, confidence intervals, and statistical interpretations to support data-driven decision making.

The project emphasizes understanding the meaning behind statistical results rather than just performing calculations.
